        I am a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater looking to get a 
          first step into an IT career. The idea of working with computers has always interested me all my life. 
          When I learned of the existence of coding, it was extremely cool 
          to me that lines of code can turn something static into an 
          interactive marvel. At the same time, a bland and colorless page 
          can become an interesting and colorful page that is easy to 
          navigate with a combination of coding languages like 
          JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. With my degree in Computer Science and 
          love of learning about this field, I believe I will be a great 
          addition to a software development crew or technical support team.
